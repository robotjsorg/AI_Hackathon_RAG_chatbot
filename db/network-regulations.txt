Network Access Regulations
1. VPN Usage
Mandatory VPN for Remote Access: All remote access to the company's internal network must be conducted through the company's VPN. Direct access to internal systems without VPN usage is strictly prohibited.
VPN Client Security: VPN clients must be kept up to date with the latest security patches. Employees are responsible for ensuring their VPN software is updated regularly.
Encryption Standards: VPN connections must use strong encryption protocols (e.g., AES-256) to secure data transmission between the remote user and the company network.
2. Cloud Access
Approved Cloud Services: Employees may only use cloud services that have been approved by the IT department. Use of unapproved cloud services for storing or processing company data is prohibited.
Access Control for Cloud Services: Access to cloud resources must be controlled using robust authentication mechanisms, such as single sign-on (SSO) and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
Data Encryption: All sensitive data stored in cloud services must be encrypted at rest and in transit. Encryption keys should be managed securely, following best practices for key management.
3. Remote Desktop and Application Access
Secure Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP): Remote desktop access must be secured using VPN and MFA. Open RDP ports directly accessible from the internet are prohibited.
Application Whitelisting: Only approved applications may be accessed remotely. The IT department maintains a whitelist of applications that can be securely accessed via remote desktop or application virtualization platforms.
Session Timeout: Remote desktop and application sessions must automatically log out after a period of inactivity to prevent unauthorized access.
4. Network Segmentation and Isolation
Internal Network Segmentation: Critical systems and sensitive data must be isolated from the general network using segmentation techniques such as VLANs and firewalls. Access between segments should be tightly controlled and monitored.
Guest Network: A separate guest network must be provided for non-employees and temporary visitors. This network must be isolated from the internal corporate network to prevent unauthorized access to company resources.
IoT and BYOD Isolation: Internet of Things (IoT) devices and Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) systems must be placed on isolated networks with limited access to essential resources only.
5. Identity and Access Management (IAM)
Strong Authentication Methods: All network access, including cloud services, VPN, and remote desktops, must use strong authentication methods such as MFA and biometrics.
Periodic Credential Review: User credentials and access rights must be reviewed periodically to ensure they are still necessary and appropriate for the user's role.
Deprovisioning: When employees leave the company or change roles, their access to networks and cloud services must be promptly revoked or adjusted to reflect their new role.
6. Monitoring and Logging
Activity Logging: All access to company networks, VPNs, and cloud services must be logged. Logs should include details such as the user, time of access, and resources accessed.
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM): Implement a SIEM solution to aggregate and analyze logs from various sources, providing real-time alerting and historical analysis of security events.
Regular Audits: Conduct regular audits of access logs and network activity to identify and address any unauthorized access or suspicious behavior.
7. Data Transfer and Sharing
Secure File Transfer: All file transfers between company systems and external parties must use secure protocols such as SFTP or HTTPS. Use of insecure protocols (e.g., FTP) is prohibited.
Data Sharing Policies: Establish clear policies for sharing data with third parties. Sensitive data must be shared only when absolutely necessary and with appropriate security measures in place.
Data Residency Requirements: Ensure compliance with data residency requirements, storing data in regions or countries as mandated by regulatory or contractual obligations.
8. Endpoint Security
Endpoint Protection: All endpoints accessing the company network must have up-to-date antivirus, antimalware, and endpoint protection software installed and active.
Device Compliance Checks: Devices must pass compliance checks for security configurations (e.g., encryption, patch level, endpoint protection) before being allowed to connect to the network or cloud services.
Mobile Device Management (MDM): Implement MDM solutions to enforce security policies on mobile devices, including remote wipe capabilities for lost or stolen devices.
9. Security Awareness and Training
Access Security Training: Provide regular training for employees on best practices for secure network access, including VPN usage, cloud service access, and recognizing phishing attempts.
Policy Acknowledgment: Employees must acknowledge understanding and acceptance of network access policies annually as part of their security training program.
Phishing Simulations: Conduct regular phishing simulations to test and improve employee awareness of phishing risks and appropriate responses.
